This directory contains the required code to handle telnet-like
authorization for the dCapDoors. The plugin is compiled with
"make" and the library can be used by setting the following two
environment variables:


DCACHE_IO_TUNNEL 		= specify the location of the plugin
				  to be loaded by dccp and invoked
				  on each communication with the door
DCACHE_IO_TUNNEL_TELNET_PWD 	= instructs the tunnel to use a file
				  for reading the authorization tokens
				  instead of the console (for Grid
				  submission)
